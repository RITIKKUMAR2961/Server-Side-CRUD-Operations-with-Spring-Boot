# Server-Side-CRUD-Operations-with-Spring-Boot
I am currently learning CRUD operations in a runtime environment without using a database. The data is stored only on the server side during runtime. I have implemented the backend using Spring Boot, where I perform GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations. The data is handled using the POST method with a JSON file, taking input for student details, including student ID, name, and section.
